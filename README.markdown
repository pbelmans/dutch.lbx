## Introduction
This is a translation of the file `dutch.lbx` in the [`biblatex` package](http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) with its SourceForge page located at [sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex/). Many small (and some big) issues were fixed, I hope I haven't introduced any new ones.

I will try to get this file in the new release of `biblatex`.

## Use
Just place the file `dutch.lbx` in `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/biblatex/lbx/`. For more information, see my blog post about it: [An update to `dutch.lbx` in `babelbib`](http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/an-update-to-dutch-lbx-in-babelbib/).
